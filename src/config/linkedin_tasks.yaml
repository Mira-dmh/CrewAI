    - Job Title: {job_title} (REQUIRED)
    - Location: {location} (optional - city, state, zip code)
    - Company: {company} (optional - specific company or leave empty for all)

linkedin_scraping_task:
  description: >
    You are tasked with finding REAL LinkedIn job postings using your tools.
    
    USER INPUT PARAMETERS:
    - Job Title: {job_title} (REQUIRED)
    - Location: {location}
    - Company: {company}
    - Job Type: {job_type}
    - Work Mode: {remote_option}
    - Date Posted: {date_posted}
    - Work Authorization: {work_authorization}
    
    STEP 1: Use the "Search LinkedIn Jobs with Filters" tool
    - Pass all user parameters as JSON to get the search strategy
    
    STEP 2: Use SerperDev tool to search LinkedIn (MULTIPLE SEARCHES)
    - Build a SIMPLE search query: "site:linkedin.com/jobs [job_title] [location]"
    - Do NOT include too many filters in the search query - it makes searches fail
    - Start broad, then filter results programmatically
    - SerperDev will return up to 50 results per search
    - **IMPORTANT**: To get more jobs, perform MULTIPLE searches with variations:
      * Search 1: "site:linkedin.com/jobs [job_title] [location]"
      * Search 2: "site:linkedin.com/jobs [job_title] [broader_location]" (e.g., state instead of zip)
      * Search 3: "site:linkedin.com/jobs [related_job_title] [location]" (e.g., "data analyst" → "business analyst")
    - Combine results from all searches to get 30-50+ unique jobs
    - Example working query: "site:linkedin.com/jobs data analyst Pennsylvania"
    - Example backup query: "site:linkedin.com/jobs data analyst"
    
    STEP 3: Extract job data from SerperDev results
    For EACH result from ALL searches (aim for 30-50+ unique jobs):
    - Extract job_id from LinkedIn URL (numbers after /jobs/view/)
    - **SKIP** results that are collection pages (e.g., "2000+ jobs in...")
    - **ONLY KEEP** results with specific job IDs in the URL
    - Get job_title from the result title
    - Get company_name from the result
    - Get location from the result
    - Infer employment_type from title/description (Full-time, Part-time, Internship, Contract)
    - Infer work_arrangement from description (Remote, Hybrid, On-site)
    - Infer experience_level (Entry level, Mid-Senior level, Executive)
    - Extract salary_range if mentioned in snippet
    - Use result snippet as job_description
    - Extract qualifications if mentioned
    - Build application_url: https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/[job_id]
    - Parse date_posted - distinguish "Posted X ago" vs "Reposted X ago"
    - Set is_repost: true if "Reposted" appears, false otherwise
    - Store raw date string in date_info_raw
    - Look for work_authorization keywords (visa, sponsorship, OPT, CPT, H-1B)
    - Extract applicant_count if shown (e.g., "50 applicants")
    - **Remove duplicates** - keep only unique job_ids
    
    STEP 4: Return structured JSON with 30-50+ unique jobs
    - Combine results from all searches
    - Remove duplicates by job_id
    - Sort by most recent date first
    - Target: 30-50 jobs minimum (more is better!)
    
    IMPORTANT:
    - You MUST use SerperDev tool to get real LinkedIn results
    - Do NOT make up job postings
    - Extract information from actual search results
    - If SerperDev returns fewer than 50, that's okay - return what you find
    - Sort results by most recent date first

linkedin_market_trends_task:
  description: >
    **CRITICAL**: Analyze the ACTUAL LinkedIn job postings data provided by the LinkedIn Scraper agent.
    DO NOT search for external market data - extract ALL insights from the job_postings JSON data.
    
    **DATA SOURCE**: Use the output from linkedin_scraping_task which contains:
    - "search_metadata": job count, search parameters
    - "job_postings": array of job objects with fields like salary_range, location, company_name, 
      job_description, required_skills, experience_level, employment_type, etc.
    
    **ANALYSIS TASKS**:
    1. **Read job descriptions and extract skills**: Parse EVERY job's "job_description" and "required_skills" 
       fields to identify technical skills (Python, SQL, Java, etc.), tools (Tableau, Excel, etc.), 
       and soft skills (communication, teamwork, etc.). Count frequency across ALL jobs.
    
    2. **Parse salary data**: Extract salary information from "salary_range" field for ALL jobs. 
       Calculate minimum, maximum, and average. Handle various formats like "$80K-$100K", 
       "$80,000 - $100,000/year", "80000-100000", etc.
    
    3. **Analyze locations**: Count jobs by "location" field to identify high-demand geographic areas.
    
    4. **Identify top companies**: Count jobs by "company_name" to find top hiring companies.
    
    5. **Experience level distribution**: Count jobs by "experience_level" (Entry, Mid, Senior).
    
    6. **Employment type breakdown**: Count "employment_type" (Full-time, Part-time, Contract, etc.).
    
    7. **Remote work options**: Count "remote_option" (Remote, Hybrid, On-site).
    
    **OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS**:
    - ALL numbers must be REAL counts from the actual data
    - Skills list must include ONLY skills found in job descriptions
    - Salary ranges must be CALCULATED from actual posted salaries
    - Company names must be EXACT names from job postings
    - Use current date (2025-11-11) for analysis_date

linkedin_verification_task:
  description: >
    **MISSION**: Verify EACH LinkedIn job posting against trusted ground truth sources and generate 
    quantitative confidence scores using the LinkedIn Job Data Verifier tool.
    
    **GROUND TRUTH SOURCES** (Must reference these):
    1. **U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)** - Official median wages and employment data
    2. **Glassdoor** - Salary ranges, company reviews, and market benchmarks
    3. **Indeed** - Job market trends and salary statistics
    4. **PayScale** - Compensation benchmarks by title and location
    5. **LinkedIn Salary Insights** - Platform's own salary data
    6. **Levels.fyi** - Tech industry salary data (for tech roles)
    
    **VERIFICATION PROCESS**:
    For EACH job posting in the input data:
    
    STEP 1: Use the "LinkedIn Job Data Verifier" tool
    - Pass the job posting data as JSON string
    - Tool will automatically verify against 6 dimensions:
      * Salary Verification (30% weight) - Compare against BLS/Glassdoor/PayScale
      * Company Verification (20% weight) - Validate against LinkedIn/Glassdoor/Fortune lists
      * Job Title Normalization (15% weight) - Check against O*NET taxonomy
      * Location Market Data (15% weight) - Verify against BLS regional data
      * Temporal Consistency (10% weight) - Flag outdated postings (>3 months)
      * Link Validity (10% weight) - Verify LinkedIn URL formats
    
    STEP 2: Collect verification report for each job
    - overall_confidence_score (0-1 scale)
    - confidence_level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
    - component_scores (breakdown by dimension)
    - flagged_issues (anomalies and warnings)
    - recommendations (actionable next steps)
    
    STEP 3: Aggregate results
    - Calculate average confidence score across all jobs
    - Count jobs by confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
    - Identify most common issues
    - Flag critical issues requiring immediate attention
    
    **DATE VALIDATION** (Critical):
    - "Reposted X ago" = job was RE-POSTED, not originally posted
    - "Posted X ago" = original posting time
    - Flag jobs older than 3 months as potentially filled
    - Flag jobs older than 1 year as invalid
    
    **OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS**:
    Return comprehensive verification report with trust scores for ALL jobs.
