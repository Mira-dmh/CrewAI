verify_research_task:
  description: >
    Review the job research summary produced by the Research Agent and determine its
    factual accuracy, logical consistency, and data validity using multiple verification
    dimensions. Each feature contributes a weighted score toward the final
    Verification Confidence Score (0-1 scale).

    Verification features and weights:
    [
      {
        "feature": "Link validity",
        "description": "Confirm that all links return HTTP 200 and originate from reputable domains (.edu, .gov, .org, or major .com).",
        "weight": 0.1
      },
      {
        "feature": "Cross-source agreement",
        "description": "Measure semantic similarity (cosine > 0.85) across three or more independent sources from different domains to ensure factual overlap.",
        "weight": 0.3
      },
      {
        "feature": "Schema alignment",
        "description": "Compare structured fields (skills, salary, education, duties) against canonical O*NET schema in onet_snapshot.json to validate mapping and values.",
        "weight": 0.3
      },
      {
        "feature": "Recency",
        "description": "Ensure all referenced data and sources are no more than 12 months old.",
        "weight": 0.1
      },
      {
        "feature": "Logical consistency",
        "description": "Run LLM-based consistency checks to verify that claims do not contradict each other and align with established occupational standards.",
        "weight": 0.2
      }
    ]

    Combine all features to compute:
    Verification_Confidence_Score = Σ(weight_i × normalized_feature_score_i)
